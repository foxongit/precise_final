# TypeScript Migration Summary

## Completed Tasks

- Migrated the following JSX files to TSX:
  - `App.jsx` -> `App.tsx`
  - `main.jsx` -> `main.tsx`
  - `components/ActivityLog.jsx` -> `components/ActivityLog.tsx`
  - `components/Auth.jsx` -> `components/Auth.tsx`
  - `components/Dashboard.jsx` -> `components/Dashboard.tsx`
  - `components/DocumentViewer.jsx` -> `components/DocumentViewer.tsx`
  - `components/Home.jsx` -> `components/Home.tsx`
  - `components/Sidebar.jsx` -> `components/Sidebar.tsx`

- Migrated the following JS files to TS:
  - `lib/supabase.js` -> `lib/supabase.ts`
  - `services/api.js` -> `services/api.ts`

- Created type definitions:
  - `types/index.ts` - Contains shared interfaces for the application
  - `types/global.d.ts` - Contains global type declarations for window objects

- Updated environment typing in `vite-env.d.ts`

- Improved API typing with more specific interfaces:
  - Added proper typing for API responses
  - Added interface definitions for request parameters
  - Fixed axios interceptor typing with `InternalAxiosRequestConfig`

## Next Steps

1. Run the `cleanup-old-js-files.bat` script to remove old JavaScript files
2. Test the application to ensure everything works correctly after the migration
3. Run the TypeScript compiler to check for any remaining type errors
4. Consider enabling stricter TypeScript rules in tsconfig.json over time

## Benefits of TypeScript Migration

- Improved code maintainability with static typing
- Better IDE support with autocomplete and type checking
- Reduced runtime errors due to type safety
- Better documentation through type definitions
- Enhanced developer experience with better tooling
